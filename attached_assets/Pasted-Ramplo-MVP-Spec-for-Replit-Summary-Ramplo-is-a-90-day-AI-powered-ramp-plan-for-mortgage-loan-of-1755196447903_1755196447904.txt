Ramplo — MVP Spec for Replit
Summary:
Ramplo is a 90-day AI-powered “ramp plan” for mortgage loan officers to get their first 1–3 deals. Morty customers get free access, non-Morty users pay $49/mo. We’re using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and magic link authentication (no passwords). Hosting will be on Vercel.

Core Pages & Flow:

Login Page

Email field only

Clicking “Sign In” sends a magic link via email

If first-time user → redirect to Onboarding Questionnaire instead of dashboard

Onboarding Questionnaire (Register)

Collects info for AI personalization (experience level, market, network size, preferred outreach channels, goals)

On submit → show a loading state (“We’re building your ramp plan…”) → then confirmation text:

“Your ramp plan is ready! To view it, click the secure link we just sent to your email.”

Email magic link to their dashboard

For Morty users (detect via email domain) → bypass payment

For non-Morty users → dashboard shows pricing panel until subscribed

Dashboard

Streak tracker (days with all tasks done)

Loan progress tracker (Applications Submitted vs Loans Closed)

Daily tasks (3–5/day) from AI-generated roadmap

When a task is marked done → success message + optional “jump ahead” tip or resource

If non-Morty and unsubscribed → overlay paywall ($49/mo) with subscription form (Stripe)

Roadmap Page

Personalized 90-day AI plan broken into 13 weeks (5 workdays/week)

Each week’s tasks can be viewed in advance, but only current day is interactive
